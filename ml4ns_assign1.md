# ML for Natural Science Assignment1
* SubTask 1: To train a model that overfits provided dataset with 70%+ accuracy in the dataset provided.
* SubTask 2: To divide the dataset appropriately, and plot training, validation accuracy/loss.
* SubTask 3: The code should have option to save/load model weights and do only a pass to compute validation accuracy.
* SubTask 4: The code should be able to train in Ada(any remote server) on gpu.


# Assignment Goals:
* Literature Reviewing( Reading)
* Gaining understanding of different Deep Learning Techniques through hands-on application.
* Following the Honor Code.

# Setting Up and running the Code by evaluators on their machine
* **Clone the repo**:-  git clone https://github.com/prtk1729/Digit_Sum_ml4ns.git
* The evaluators need to fill in their credentials inorder to clone the repo.
* The above command creates a folder ==> 'Digit_Sum_ml4ns'

* cd Digit_Sum_ml4ns
* We need to unzip the train_set.zip and val_set.zip 





# Setting Up and running the Code by evaluators on their machine
* Clone the repo: "git clone https://github.com/prtk1729/Annotation-Tool.git" inside the above created folder.

* Once the repo is cloned navigate to - <ann_tool>/Annotation-Tool/anaconda/anaconda
* Activate a venv/ a conda environment with (python 3.6 or higher) and type "pip install -r requirements.txt".Alternatively, We could simply type this command if we have pip installed with (python 3.6 or higher) without creating a new environment.
